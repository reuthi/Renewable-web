It is easy to see why many family offices, pension funds, and other entities prefer to transact in such assets either through an LP or other mechanisms. </p>  <p>We focus on Renewable Energy properties, but with the ever-evolving dynamics of our economy, it is always interesting to take a step back and compare different asset classes and subclasses and consider which investors get the upper hand in the world of infrastructure. The endless chase to optimize asset cashflows and keep projections alive has fund managers and investors of all sizes researching the best options for their portfolio.</p> <p>For now, we will touch upon the core infrastructure deals reviewed by most private equities and family offices. The three asset classes are renewable energy (Solar, Wind, etc.), oil and gas upstream, and real estate. As it is our view that diversification is key in infrastructure as in any portfolio – we thought it would be interesting to explore and compare these three asset classes. When comparing these three asset classes, one wonders which is best for the passive investor (Could be LP, or less active player). So, in the following few weeks we will explore the differences through various articles put together by the Renewable Listing team. We believe that comparing the three most sought after asset classes will help illuminate some of the questions and concerns that fund investors face when comparing properties.</p> <p>We don’t believe that it is our place to decide the best asset class, nor do we believe that there is such a thing. We are simply looking to highlight advantages and risks in each opportunity.</p> <p>When comparing different assets, we will analyze a wide range of parameters including Stability of Income, Credit Risk, Maintenance, Appreciation, Responsibility to Our Planet, Scale, Construction Risk, and Liquidity.</p> <p>We also encourage you to reach out to us with any thoughts or ideas as we are very eager to create a discussion around this.

There are a few key data points which are relevant. Production of electricity from the sun or wind is a much simpler process than the extraction of minerals from deep in the earth. With traditional extraction, the tremendous upstream pressures and constant moving pieces often cause production stoppages and reduced cashflows. In real estate, finding the right tenant is a key ingredient to cashflow stability. </p> <p> Furthermore – credit risk is very relevant as a group’s ability to pay is key to cashflow stability. </p> <p> Credit Risk</p> <p> There are three types of off-takers within the renewable space, and each affects credit risk differently. </p> <p> The first is the local state or utility. In this case, you are taking relatively very little credit risk, as your receiving party usually has a very strong balance sheet and credit rating. </p> <p> Another option is a corporate/private PPA with a local player (could be the owner of your roof, etc.). Here, like in a real estate transaction, you are subject to tenant risk. </p> <p> Finally, for more competitive markets, you can sell directly to the grid, which resembles hub pricing for a fully liquid Brent, crude, or Henry Hub (in Natural Gas), each of which can be mixed and matched depending on the structure you can retain. </p> <p> Credit risk in real estate is very much dependent on the tenant, which can range from government tenants to “Joe Shmoe’s Burger Shack.” Credit risk in North America for oil and gas is related to a hub and so there is little credit issue but pricing fluctuates much more than a long term agreement. You are exposed to the volatility of the market, whereas in a 20 year PPA or lease agreement you are not. </p> <p> We also want to encourage that you reach out to us with any thoughts or ideas as we are very eager to create a discussion around this.

Companies often look at cashflow numbers alone, but what if that cashflow depends on seamless operations and maintenance? In the case of solar – there is usually a warranty from most installers/suppliers and cleaning the system is straight forward. Wind and hydro take more work, although they are still very manageable. For peace of mind, it is a great idea to invest in Solar and other renewables. In oil and gas, upstream maintenance requires a full on management team or a non-operator position, which has its challenges with the operator. These teams are very difficult to put together and incredibly expensive. Real estate maintenance often depends on the tenant you have – residential leases typically require more upkeep whereas commercial agreements sometimes assign full maintenance responsibilities to the tenant. </p> <p>Asset appreciation is also a very interesting metric, as you want to know that in addition to cashflow, your underlying investment is maintaining or increasing in value. In this case, Renewables are at a disadvantage to the other asset classes. However, there is always value to the project from the ongoing cashflow, and taking on a project at an early stage really helps. In comparison - real estate has historically increased in value over time. Oil and gas is a bit more tricky, and depends heavily on the specific asset and upside potential in the regional basin. </p> <p>Responsibility to our planet is a metric which is a no-brainer here.  So we won’t talk about it much, except to say that creating clean energy is something that can help shift our ecosystem in a more positive direction.</p> <p>The last topic we would like to discuss is construction risk. Real estate has frequent budgeting shifts. Drilling in oil and gas can be problematic and it can be very tricky to implement PUD’s (proved undeveloped resources). With renewables, you are talking about a relatively simple process in both wind and solar, and these projects turn around fairly quickly. </p> <p>We also want to encourage that you reach out to us with any thoughts or ideas as we are very eager to create a discussion around this.
